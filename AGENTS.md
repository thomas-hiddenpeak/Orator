## OVERVIEW

Real-time edge-deployed (Jetson Orin/Thor) auditory pipeline. Ingests mono PCM audio over WebSocket, runs diarization (Sortformer) + ASR (Qwen3-ASR) + VAD as three independent pipelines on a shared time base, and outputs a comprehensive timeline JSON.

## WHERE TO LOOK

| Task | Location | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| Add/change a model | `include/core/stages.h` + `include/model/` + `src/model/` | Implement interface, register, never edit consumers |
| Change pipeline orchestration | `include/pipeline/` + `src/pipeline/` | Workers under `AuditoryStream` controller |
| Modify time base | `include/core/time_base.h` | All pipelines inherit from `buffer_.time_base()` |
| Change transport | `include/net/` + `src/net/` | libwebsockets-based, not raw POSIX |
| Add a protocol topic | `include/protocol/` + `src/protocol/` | Topic registry + schema registry |
| GPU kernel work | `include/gpu/` + `src/gpu/` | Kernels validated against CPU reference |
| Understand project state | `specs/PROJECT_STATE.md` | Must verify claims against code (Art. VIII) |
| Constitutional rules | `.specify/memory/constitution.md` | Highest authority — read before any non-trivial work |

## CONVENTIONS

### Code style (Constitution Art. V)
- Google C++ Style: 2-space indent, `PascalCase` types/methods, `lower_snake_case` locals, trailing-underscore `member_` fields, `I`-prefixed interfaces, `#pragma once`
- No `new`/`delete`/`cudaMalloc` on perf paths without owning RAII wrapper
- Every CUDA call error-checked
- Functions small, single-purpose

### Layering (strict, enforced in review)
Dependencies point inward toward `core/`:
```
gpu/ io/ → core/ → model/ → pipeline/ → net/ → protocol/
```
Consumers depend on interfaces, never on concrete models.

### SDD workflow (mandatory for non-trivial work)
1. Read constitution → spec (WHAT/WHY) → plan (HOW) → tasks (verifiable steps)
2. Implement only after spec/plan/tasks reviewed
3. Validate: build clean (`-Wall -Wextra`), `ctest` pass, real streaming path for perf claims
4. Update `PROJECT_STATE.md` + spec status lines in the same change (Art. VIII)

### Pipeline decoupling
- Pipelines communicate ONLY through `ComprehensiveTimeline` — no callbacks, no shared pointers, no atomic flags between pipelines
- Three consistency principles: origin → process → result (Art. III)

### File structure
- One responsibility per type and per file
- Public header exposes contract; implementation stays in `.cc`/`.cu`
- `core/` = contracts + data types only

---

## ANTI-PATTERNS (FORBIDDEN)

- **Runtime third-party dependencies** — zero tolerance (Art. I). Python/PyTorch only in `tools/` as offline oracles.
- **`as any` / `@ts-ignore` / `@ts-expect-error`** — never. This is C++/CUDA; no type escape hatches.
- **Raw `new`/`delete`/`cudaMalloc` without owning wrapper** — RAII required.
- **Pipelines reading each other's data directly** — must go through `ComprehensiveTimeline`.
- **Time codes computed with ad hoc arithmetic** — must use `TimeBase::SecondsAt()` / `SampleAt()` / `Duration()`.
- **Unvalidated numerical changes** — every model stage validated against PyTorch/NeMo oracle before considered done (Art. II).
- **Speculative features / unrelated refactors** — make only the requested change (Art. V §6).
- **Stale state docs** — verify against code before trusting (Art. VIII).
- **Shotgun debugging** — fix root cause, not symptoms. Revert to last known good state after 3 failures.

## GOOGLE AGENT SKILLS ROUTING

This project uses a **Google Agent Skills** routing mechanism for complex multi-step tasks. High-level skill packages are stored in `.agents/skills/`.

### How it works

1. **Skill packages** live under `.agents/skills/<skill-name>/`, each containing a `SKILL.md` entry point.
2. **Before** executing any complex or cross-cutting task — such as frontend architecture, cloud deployment, CI/CD pipeline changes, performance profiling, security audits, or large refactors — the AI **MUST**:
   - Check if `.agents/skills/` exists and contains a relevant skill directory.
   - If found, read the corresponding `SKILL.md` for specialized guidance, constraints, and step-by-step protocols.
   - Follow the skill's instructions as supplementary rules on top of this file and the Constitution.
3. **Skill categories** (when implemented) may include:
   - `frontend-arch` — Web UI architecture decisions, SPA patterns
   - `cloud-deploy` — Deployment, containerization, CI/CD
   - `perf-profiling` — GPU/CPU profiling methodology
   - `security-review` — Vulnerability auditing protocols
   - `refactor-large` — Large-scale refactoring strategies

### Fallback behavior
If `.agents/skills/` does not exist or no matching skill is found, proceed using this AGENTS.md + the Constitution as the sole guidance. The skills mechanism is an optional augmentation layer.

### Relationship with SDD
Google Agent Skills complement but do **not** replace the SDD workflow (constitution → spec → plan → tasks → implement). For any non-trivial work:
1. Check `.agents/skills/` for a relevant skill → read `SKILL.md`
2. Follow the SDD workflow (constitution → spec → plan → tasks → implement)
3. If the skill conflicts with the Constitution, the **Constitution wins**

## EXISTING SDD RULES (Spec-Driven Development)

This project follows **Spec-Driven Development (SDD)** adapted from spec-kit. These rules are authoritative:

### Truth hierarchy
1. **Code** is authoritative over all documents (Constitution Art. VIII)
2. **Constitution** (`.specify/memory/constitution.md`) — highest written authority
3. **Project state** (`specs/PROJECT_STATE.md`) — describes current code state, subordinate to code
4. **Spec artifacts** (`specs/NNN-feature/spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md`) — define work in progress
5. **Test review protocol** (`.specify/test-review-protocol.md`) — governance for manual-style evaluation

### Mandatory workflow
1. Read constitution + project state first
2. Create/update `spec.md` (WHAT/WHY, testable requirements)
3. Create/update `plan.md` (HOW: architecture, data flow, threading, risks)
4. Create/update `tasks.md` (small, ordered, independently verifiable)
5. Implement only after spec/plan/tasks are reviewed
6. Validate: build clean + `ctest` pass + real streaming path when applicable
7. Record verified lessons; sync state docs in the same change

### Constitutional hard rules
- **Zero runtime deps** (C++20/CUDA only, Art. I)
- **Accuracy first** (Art. II) — no quality trade-off without explicit approval
- **Common time base + independent pipelines** (Art. III)
- **Streaming validation through real WebSocket** (Art. IV)
- **Engineering quality mandatory** (Art. V) — readability, RAII, race-free, small functions
- **Precise terminology** — no metaphors, no jargon (Art. VI)
- **Docs match code** — status advances in same change (Art. VIII)

### Source files
- `.specify/memory/constitution.md` — the Constitution
- `specs/PROJECT_STATE.md` — project state with verification evidence
- `specs/NNN-feature-name/spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md` — per-feature SDD artifacts
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` — expanded SDD prompt with validation checklist
- `.specify/test-review-protocol.md` — test evaluation governance

## NOTES

- **Large files** tracked via Git LFS: `*.safetensors`, `*.npz`, `*.npy`, `*.f32`, `*.i32`, `*.pcm`
- **Build output** in `build/` and `build_debug/` — both in `.gitignore`
- **AI session runtime data** in `.omo/` — also gitignored
- **GPU telemetry** disabled by default; opt-in via `ORATOR_GPU_TELEMETRY_SEC`
- **Log level** controlled by `ORATOR_LOG_LEVEL` env var or `[debug].log_level` in `orator.toml` (0=DEBUG .. 3=ERROR)
- **Runtime config** via `orator.toml` (TOML format). All ~35 runtime parameters in 8 sections. Loading order: defaults → CLI → `orator.toml` → env. See `include/io/config_reader.h`.
- **Specs 001-004 completed and verified.** Spec 006 (Web UI MVP) implemented. Active work follows Spec 004 protocol layer.
